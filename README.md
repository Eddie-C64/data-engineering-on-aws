# Data Engineering On AWS
Repository containing RDMS, AWS Redshift, Datalake with S3, and other data engineering examples on AWS.


### 1) [Postgres star schema](https://github.com/Eddie-C64/sparkify-etl-postgres-db)
Following the traditional star schema of a fact and dimensional table. This project does a etl process on json data.

### 2) [Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/Eddie-C64/nosql-with-cassandra)
In this project you leverage the power of NoSQL database for speed over consistency.

### 3) [Data Warehouse on AWS Redshift](https://github.com/Eddie-C64/aws-redshift-datawarehouse)
Using multiple sources, one can create a simple data warehouse for the purpose of analytics and business rules to be followed.

### 4) [Data Lake using Apache Spark and AWS S3](https://github.com/Eddie-C64/datalake-on-aws-with-spark)
Create something more modular for data scientist to play around with. This datalake has a lot less structured form than a data warehouse but allows one to query nearly every data source.

### 5) [Scheduling Production Pipelines using Apache AirFlow]()

### 6) [S3 Datalake to ML Production Model]()
